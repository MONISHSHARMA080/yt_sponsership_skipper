[start 0.28] this video is brought to you by nebula [Duration: 4.68]
[start 3.04] ever since the Hamas attack on October [Duration: 4.16]
[start 4.96] the 7th social media has been filled [Duration: 4.92]
[start 7.2] with videos of pro Palestine protests in [Duration: 5.24]
[start 9.88] City centers and University campuses [Duration: 4.799]
[start 12.44] across the West what makes these [Duration: 4.36]
[start 14.679] protests so striking is not just their [Duration: 4.76]
[start 16.8] ubiquity and frequency but also the fact [Duration: 5.68]
[start 19.439] that the protesters are so young this [Duration: 5.121]
[start 22.48] Bears out in polling to a historically [Duration: 4.68]
[start 24.56] unprecedented extent young people today [Duration: 4.24]
[start 27.16] are way more likely than older [Duration: 4.399]
[start 28.8] generations to support Palestine over [Duration: 4.759]
[start 31.559] Israel so in this video we're going to [Duration: 3.201]
[start 33.559] have a look at how the younger [Duration: 3.561]
[start 34.76] generation's opinions of Israel differ [Duration: 4.639]
[start 37.12] not just from today's older Generations [Duration: 5]
[start 39.399] but also from previous young generations [Duration: 5.081]
[start 42.12] and try our best to explain why this [Duration: 3.32]
[start 44.48] might [Duration: 4.28]
[start 45.44] [Music] [Duration: 5.56]
[start 48.76] be before we start if you haven't [Duration: 4.439]
[start 51] already please consider subscribing and [Duration: 3.92]
[start 53.199] ringing the bell to stay in the loop and [Duration: 4.401]
[start 54.92] be notified when we release new [Duration: 4.72]
[start 57.6] videos so let's start by looking at the [Duration: 2.959]
[start 59.64] poll [Duration: 2.599]
[start 60.559] the first thing to say is that the fact [Duration: 3.481]
[start 62.239] that young people are more Pro Palestine [Duration: 4.56]
[start 64.04] than older people isn't an entirely new [Duration: 4.92]
[start 66.799] phenomenon Gallup polling suggests that [Duration: 3.921]
[start 68.96] younger Americans have always been [Duration: 3.64]
[start 70.72] slightly more Pro Palestine than their [Duration: 4.12]
[start 72.6] older counterparts or at least since [Duration: 4]
[start 74.84] Gallup started measuring sentiment by [Duration: 6.319]
[start 76.6] generation in 2001 in 2002 for example [Duration: 6.519]
[start 81.159] net sympathy for Israel I.E the [Duration: 3.521]
[start 83.119] percentage of people saying they were [Duration: 3.801]
[start 84.68] more sympathetic to Israel minus the [Duration: 3.56]
[start 86.92] percentage of people saying they were [Duration: 4.04]
[start 88.24] more sympathetic to Palestine was 36 for [Duration: 5.64]
[start 90.96] Generation X which is 23 to 37 year olds [Duration: 6.119]
[start 93.88] 43 for Baby Boomers which is 38 to 56 [Duration: 5.559]
[start 97.079] year olds and 48 for the silent [Duration: 4.961]
[start 99.439] generation which is anyone older than [Duration: 5.921]
[start 102.04] 56 in other words back in 2002 every [Duration: 5.679]
[start 105.36] generation was broadly pro-israel but [Duration: 4.2]
[start 107.719] older Generations were slightly more [Duration: 3.961]
[start 109.56] pro-israel than their younger [Duration: 4.239]
[start 111.68] counterparts however today two things [Duration: 4.16]
[start 113.799] have changed first the gap between [Duration: 3.801]
[start 115.84] younger and older Generations has [Duration: 4.36]
[start 117.6] widened significantly while while in [Duration: 4.559]
[start 120.2] 2002 there were only a couple of points [Duration: 4.16]
[start 122.159] difference between Generations Gallup [Duration: 4]
[start 124.36] polling conducted a few months before [Duration: 3.879]
[start 126.159] hamas's attack found that there's a more [Duration: 4.8]
[start 128.239] than 30 point difference in net sympathy [Duration: 4.841]
[start 130.959] towards Israel between Millennials and [Duration: 4.92]
[start 133.08] Gen X with a nearly 50 point gap between [Duration: 5.84]
[start 135.879] Millennials and Baby Boomers but second [Duration: 5.241]
[start 138.92] younger people are for the first time in [Duration: 4.48]
[start 141.12] American history more likely to be Pro [Duration: 5.28]
[start 143.4] Palestine than pro Israel Gallup polling [Duration: 4.919]
[start 146.4] suggests that Millennials today have a [Duration: 4.68]
[start 148.319] net sympathy towards Israel of minus two [Duration: 4.321]
[start 151.08] which implies that more Millennials [Duration: 3.64]
[start 152.64] sympathize with Palestine than Israel [Duration: 4.2]
[start 154.72] it's pretty safe to assume that gen Zed [Duration: 4.72]
[start 156.84] are even more Pro Palestine given the [Duration: 4.64]
[start 159.44] dominance of pro Palestine content on [Duration: 4.079]
[start 161.48] gen Zed's favorite social media [Duration: 4.24]
[start 163.519] platforms and the fact that more recent [Duration: 4.601]
[start 165.72] polling by Harvard caps Harris has found [Duration: 4.84]
[start 168.12] that 18 to 24 year olds are likely to be [Duration: 5.32]
[start 170.56] significantly more Pro Palestine than 25 [Duration: 5.2]
[start 173.44] to 34 year olds according to this [Duration: 5.719]
[start 175.76] polling 52% of 18 to 24 year olds don't [Duration: 5.08]
[start 179.159] think that Israel well is Justified in [Duration: 4]
[start 180.84] trying to eliminate herass compared to [Duration: 5.72]
[start 183.159] just 21% in America as a whole and 64% [Duration: 6]
[start 186.56] of 18 to 24 yearolds who say that both [Duration: 5.2]
[start 189.159] sides have equally just causes compared [Duration: 5.521]
[start 191.76] to just 39% in The Wider public [Duration: 5.88]
[start 194.68] interestingly while 29% of 18 to 24 year [Duration: 5.4]
[start 197.64] olds back Hamas way more than any other [Duration: 4.92]
[start 200.08] age group young people also favor [Duration: 4.4]
[start 202.56] non-involvement more than their older [Duration: 4.44]
[start 204.48] counterparts with a plurality of 18 to [Duration: 5.319]
[start 207] 34 year olds favoring non-involvement [Duration: 5.159]
[start 209.799] but a plurality of every other age group [Duration: 5.281]
[start 212.159] advocating standing with Israel this [Duration: 5.561]
[start 215.08] isn't just an American phenomenon either [Duration: 4.519]
[start 217.72] polling conducted by The Economist has [Duration: 3.719]
[start 219.599] found that young people across most of [Duration: 3.84]
[start 221.439] Europe are not just significantly less [Duration: 3.961]
[start 223.439] pro Israel than their older counterparts [Duration: 4.401]
[start 225.4] but also generally Pro Palestine in the [Duration: 4.559]
[start 227.84] aggregate in the UK for example the [Duration: 3.92]
[start 229.959] latest polling from late October [Duration: 3.961]
[start 231.76] suggests that 18 to 24 year olds are [Duration: 4.16]
[start 233.92] four times more likely to be Pro [Duration: 4.319]
[start 235.92] Palestine than pro-israel which is [Duration: 4.44]
[start 238.239] pretty astonishing given that theuk UK [Duration: 4.84]
[start 240.36] has historically been pretty pro-israel [Duration: 5.239]
[start 243.079] and that Britain as a whole is net [Duration: 5.601]
[start 245.599] pro-israel so why is this why are young [Duration: 5.84]
[start 248.68] people so Pro Palestine well while a [Duration: 4.839]
[start 251.439] total explanation is probably beyond the [Duration: 4.561]
[start 253.519] scope of a tldr video we see at least [Duration: 5.12]
[start 256] three possible reasons the first is that [Duration: 4.68]
[start 258.639] Israel Palestine has become a leftright [Duration: 4.041]
[start 260.68] coded issue young people are more [Duration: 3.84]
[start 262.68] left-wing and the left are more likely [Duration: 4.12]
[start 264.52] to be Pro Palestine so young people are [Duration: 4.84]
[start 266.8] more Pro Palestine this SPS out in [Duration: 4.679]
[start 269.36] Poland Democrats are far more likely to [Duration: 4.44]
[start 271.479] be Pro Palestine than Republicans and [Duration: 4.081]
[start 273.8] support for Israel drops as people [Duration: 4.56]
[start 275.56] become more liberal something similar is [Duration: 5.44]
[start 278.36] also true in the UK according to Yugo [Duration: 4.92]
[start 281] polling from early November labor voters [Duration: 4.759]
[start 283.28] are far more likely to support Palestine [Duration: 4.56]
[start 285.759] than conservative voters and young [Duration: 4.16]
[start 287.84] voters are far more likely to both vote [Duration: 5.52]
[start 289.919] labor and support Palestine this has a [Duration: 5.081]
[start 293.36] lot to do with the fact that at least [Duration: 3.76]
[start 295] since the 70s and especially since [Duration: 4.96]
[start 297.12] netanyahu's returned to power in 2009 [Duration: 4.6]
[start 299.96] Israel has become an explicitly [Duration: 4.92]
[start 301.72] right-wing political project Netanyahu [Duration: 5.64]
[start 304.88] actively campaigned against Clinton and [Duration: 4.48]
[start 307.36] even visited Congress to give a prot [Duration: 5.119]
[start 309.36] trump speech without Obama's approval in [Duration: 5.96]
[start 312.479] 2015 this wasn't always the case back in [Duration: 5.201]
[start 315.32] the 50s and 60s Israeli politics was [Duration: 4.68]
[start 317.68] actually dominated by the left but it [Duration: 5.6]
[start 320] drifted right after the 1973 yam Kapur [Duration: 6.68]
[start 323.28] War the second reason is social media [Duration: 5.12]
[start 326.68] young people are far more likely to get [Duration: 3.48]
[start 328.4] their news from social media media and [Duration: 3.76]
[start 330.16] far more distrustful of established [Duration: 4.4]
[start 332.16] media a majority of Young Americans [Duration: 4.28]
[start 334.56] think that the media is biased towards [Duration: 4.84]
[start 336.44] Israel and 32% of Young Americans even [Duration: 4.599]
[start 339.4] think that the official narrative about [Duration: 4.28]
[start 341.039] the October the 7th attacks is false [Duration: 6.201]
[start 343.68] compared to 177% in the wi public data [Duration: 5]
[start 347.24] suggests that social media is [Duration: 3.239]
[start 348.68] significantly more Pro Palestine than [Duration: 3.92]
[start 350.479] traditional media analysis from The [Duration: 4.56]
[start 352.6] Economist found that while Pro Palestine [Duration: 4.48]
[start 355.039] and pro-israel posts were roughly equal [Duration: 4.121]
[start 357.08] in the immediate aftermath of October [Duration: 4.48]
[start 359.16] the 7 by October the 20th there were [Duration: 4.56]
[start 361.56] about four times as many pro Palestine [Duration: 4.44]
[start 363.72] posts on social media than pro-israel [Duration: 4.4]
[start 366] ones with Pro Palestine content [Duration: 5.36]
[start 368.12] dominating on basically every platform [Duration: 5.72]
[start 371.36] interestingly the UK has by far in way [Duration: 5.279]
[start 373.84] the most Pro Palestine social media with [Duration: 5.52]
[start 376.639] six times more Pro Palestine posts than [Duration: 5.721]
[start 379.36] pro-israel ones more recent data from [Duration: 5]
[start 382.36] axio suggests the disparity is [Duration: 4.839]
[start 384.36] particularly acute on Tik Tok which has [Duration: 5.2]
[start 387.199] one of the youngest user bases of all [Duration: 5]
[start 389.56] social media platforms according to axus [Duration: 4.759]
[start 392.199] there's been about 10 times more Pro [Duration: 4.641]
[start 394.319] Palestine posts than pro-israel ones on [Duration: 5.32]
[start 396.84] Tik Tok which have received nearly five [Duration: 4.04]
[start 399.639] times as many [Duration: 3.761]
[start 400.88] views the third reason is ethnic [Duration: 4.84]
[start 403.4] diversity in essence younger people have [Duration: 4.6]
[start 405.72] a larger non-white population and [Duration: 4.56]
[start 408] non-whites are more likely to be Pro [Duration: 4.84]
[start 410.28] Palestine in the US for instance gen Zed [Duration: 6.28]
[start 412.84] is 49% white compared to 72% White for [Duration: 5.919]
[start 416.56] Boomers according to Gallup polling [Duration: 4.44]
[start 418.759] nonwhite Americans are far less pro- [Duration: 4.56]
[start 421] Israel with a sympathy towards Israel of [Duration: 6.52]
[start 423.319] 26% compared to 58% for white Americans [Duration: 5.641]
[start 427.52] similarly white Americans have a [Duration: 3.84]
[start 428.96] favorable opinion of Israel of [Duration: 5.04]
[start 431.36] 71% while non-white Americans come in [Duration: 4.959]
[start 434] significantly lower at [Duration: 5.72]
[start 436.319] 62% so there are three tentative reasons [Duration: 5.361]
[start 439.72] that might partially explain why young [Duration: 4.56]
[start 441.68] people are so Pro Palestine again we [Duration: 4.28]
[start 444.28] want to stress that this isn't intended [Duration: 3.599]
[start 445.96] as a complete explanation and we [Duration: 3.6]
[start 447.879] recognize that opinions on the issue you [Duration: 3.361]
[start 449.56] are complicated there are any other [Duration: 3.52]
[start 451.24] reasons you can think of or if you think [Duration: 3.92]
[start 453.08] we've missed anything do let us know in [Duration: 2.959]

[start 54.92] be notified when we release new [Duration: 4.72]
[start 57.6] videos so let's start by looking at the [Duration: 2.959]
[start 59.64] poll [Duration: 2.599]
[start 60.559] the first thing to say is that the fact [Duration: 3.481]
[start 62.239] that young people are more Pro Palestine [Duration: 4.56]
[start 64.04] than older people isn't an entirely new [Duration: 4.92]
[start 66.799] phenomenon Gallup polling suggests that [Duration: 3.921]
[start 68.96] younger Americans have always been [Duration: 3.64]
[start 70.72] slightly more Pro Palestine than their [Duration: 4.12]
[start 72.6] older counterparts or at least since [Duration: 4]
[start 74.84] Gallup started measuring sentiment by [Duration: 6.319]
[start 76.6] generation in 2001 in 2002 for example [Duration: 6.519]
[start 81.159] net sympathy for Israel I.E the [Duration: 3.521]
[start 83.119] percentage of people saying they were [Duration: 3.801]
[start 84.68] more sympathetic to Israel minus the [Duration: 3.56]
[start 86.92] percentage of people saying they were [Duration: 4.04]
[start 88.24] more sympathetic to Palestine was 36 for [Duration: 5.64]
[start 90.96] Generation X which is 23 to 37 year olds [Duration: 6.119]
[start 93.88] 43 for Baby Boomers which is 38 to 56 [Duration: 5.559]
[start 97.079] year olds and 48 for the silent [Duration: 4.961]
[start 99.439] generation which is anyone older than [Duration: 5.921]
[start 102.04] 56 in other words back in 2002 every [Duration: 5.679]
[start 105.36] generation was broadly pro-israel but [Duration: 4.2]
[start 107.719] older Generations were slightly more [Duration: 3.961]
[start 109.56] pro-israel than their younger [Duration: 4.239]
[start 111.68] counterparts however today two things [Duration: 4.16]
[start 113.799] have changed first the gap between [Duration: 3.801]
[start 115.84] younger and older Generations has [Duration: 4.36]
[start 117.6] widened significantly while while in [Duration: 4.559]
[start 120.2] 2002 there were only a couple of points [Duration: 4.16]
[start 122.159] difference between Generations Gallup [Duration: 4]
[start 124.36] polling conducted a few months before [Duration: 3.879]
[start 126.159] hamas's attack found that there's a more [Duration: 4.8]
[start 128.239] than 30 point difference in net sympathy [Duration: 4.841]
[start 130.959] towards Israel between Millennials and [Duration: 4.92]
[start 133.08] Gen X with a nearly 50 point gap between [Duration: 5.84]
[start 135.879] Millennials and Baby Boomers but second [Duration: 5.241]
[start 138.92] younger people are for the first time in [Duration: 4.48]
[start 141.12] American history more likely to be Pro [Duration: 5.28]
[start 143.4] Palestine than pro Israel Gallup polling [Duration: 4.919]
[start 146.4] suggests that Millennials today have a [Duration: 4.68]
[start 148.319] net sympathy towards Israel of minus two [Duration: 4.321]
[start 151.08] which implies that more Millennials [Duration: 3.64]
[start 152.64] sympathize with Palestine than Israel [Duration: 4.2]
[start 154.72] it's pretty safe to assume that gen Zed [Duration: 4.72]
[start 156.84] are even more Pro Palestine given the [Duration: 4.64]
[start 159.44] dominance of pro Palestine content on [Duration: 4.079]
[start 161.48] gen Zed's favorite social media [Duration: 4.24]
[start 163.519] platforms and the fact that more recent [Duration: 4.601]
[start 165.72] polling by Harvard caps Harris has found [Duration: 4.84]
[start 168.12] that 18 to 24 year olds are likely to be [Duration: 5.32]
[start 170.56] significantly more Pro Palestine than 25 [Duration: 5.2]
[start 173.44] to 34 year olds according to this [Duration: 5.719]
[start 175.76] polling 52% of 18 to 24 year olds don't [Duration: 5.08]
[start 179.159] think that Israel well is Justified in [Duration: 4]
[start 180.84] trying to eliminate herass compared to [Duration: 5.72]
[start 183.159] just 21% in America as a whole and 64% [Duration: 6]
[start 186.56] of 18 to 24 yearolds who say that both [Duration: 5.2]
[start 189.159] sides have equally just causes compared [Duration: 5.521]
[start 191.76] to just 39% in The Wider public [Duration: 5.88]
[start 194.68] interestingly while 29% of 18 to 24 year [Duration: 5.4]
[start 197.64] olds back Hamas way more than any other [Duration: 4.92]
[start 200.08] age group young people also favor [Duration: 4.4]
[start 202.56] non-involvement more than their older [Duration: 4.44]
[start 204.48] counterparts with a plurality of 18 to [Duration: 5.319]
[start 207] 34 year olds favoring non-involvement [Duration: 5.159]
[start 209.799] but a plurality of every other age group [Duration: 5.281]
[start 212.159] advocating standing with Israel this [Duration: 5.561]
[start 215.08] isn't just an American phenomenon either [Duration: 4.519]
[start 217.72] polling conducted by The Economist has [Duration: 3.719]
[start 219.599] found that young people across most of [Duration: 3.84]
[start 221.439] Europe are not just significantly less [Duration: 3.961]
[start 223.439] pro Israel than their older counterparts [Duration: 4.401]
[start 225.4] but also generally Pro Palestine in the [Duration: 4.559]
[start 227.84] aggregate in the UK for example the [Duration: 3.92]
[start 229.959] latest polling from late October [Duration: 3.961]
[start 231.76] suggests that 18 to 24 year olds are [Duration: 4.16]
[start 233.92] four times more likely to be Pro [Duration: 4.319]
[start 235.92] Palestine than pro-israel which is [Duration: 4.44]
[start 238.239] pretty astonishing given that theuk UK [Duration: 4.84]
[start 240.36] has historically been pretty pro-israel [Duration: 5.239]
[start 243.079] and that Britain as a whole is net [Duration: 5.601]
[start 245.599] pro-israel so why is this why are young [Duration: 5.84]
[start 248.68] people so Pro Palestine well while a [Duration: 4.839]
[start 251.439] total explanation is probably beyond the [Duration: 4.561]
[start 253.519] scope of a tldr video we see at least [Duration: 5.12]
[start 256] three possible reasons the first is that [Duration: 4.68]
[start 258.639] Israel Palestine has become a leftright [Duration: 4.041]
[start 260.68] coded issue young people are more [Duration: 3.84]
[start 262.68] left-wing and the left are more likely [Duration: 4.12]
[start 264.52] to be Pro Palestine so young people are [Duration: 4.84]
[start 266.8] more Pro Palestine this SPS out in [Duration: 4.679]
[start 269.36] Poland Democrats are far more likely to [Duration: 4.44]
[start 271.479] be Pro Palestine than Republicans and [Duration: 4.081]
[start 273.8] support for Israel drops as people [Duration: 4.56]
[start 275.56] become more liberal something similar is [Duration: 5.44]
[start 278.36] also true in the UK according to Yugo [Duration: 4.92]
[start 281] polling from early November labor voters [Duration: 4.759]
[start 283.28] are far more likely to support Palestine [Duration: 4.56]
[start 285.759] than conservative voters and young [Duration: 4.16]
[start 287.84] voters are far more likely to both vote [Duration: 5.52]
[start 289.919] labor and support Palestine this has a [Duration: 5.081]
[start 293.36] lot to do with the fact that at least [Duration: 3.76]
[start 295] since the 70s and especially since [Duration: 4.96]
[start 297.12] netanyahu's returned to power in 2009 [Duration: 4.6]
[start 299.96] Israel has become an explicitly [Duration: 4.92]
[start 301.72] right-wing political project Netanyahu [Duration: 5.64]
[start 304.88] actively campaigned against Clinton and [Duration: 4.48]
[start 307.36] even visited Congress to give a prot [Duration: 5.119]
[start 309.36] trump speech without Obama's approval in [Duration: 5.96]
[start 312.479] 2015 this wasn't always the case back in [Duration: 5.201]
[start 315.32] the 50s and 60s Israeli politics was [Duration: 4.68]
[start 317.68] actually dominated by the left but it [Duration: 5.6]
[start 320] drifted right after the 1973 yam Kapur [Duration: 6.68]
[start 323.28] War the second reason is social media [Duration: 5.12]
[start 326.68] young people are far more likely to get [Duration: 3.48]
[start 328.4] their news from social media media and [Duration: 3.76]
[start 330.16] far more distrustful of established [Duration: 4.4]
[start 332.16] media a majority of Young Americans [Duration: 4.28]
[start 334.56] think that the media is biased towards [Duration: 4.84]
[start 336.44] Israel and 32% of Young Americans even [Duration: 4.599]
[start 339.4] think that the official narrative about [Duration: 4.28]
[start 341.039] the October the 7th attacks is false [Duration: 6.201]
[start 343.68] compared to 177% in the wi public data [Duration: 5]
[start 347.24] suggests that social media is [Duration: 3.239]
[start 348.68] significantly more Pro Palestine than [Duration: 3.92]
[start 350.479] traditional media analysis from The [Duration: 4.56]
[start 352.6] Economist found that while Pro Palestine [Duration: 4.48]
[start 355.039] and pro-israel posts were roughly equal [Duration: 4.121]
[start 357.08] in the immediate aftermath of October [Duration: 4.48]
[start 359.16] the 7 by October the 20th there were [Duration: 4.56]
[start 361.56] about four times as many pro Palestine [Duration: 4.44]
[start 363.72] posts on social media than pro-israel [Duration: 4.4]
[start 366] ones with Pro Palestine content [Duration: 5.36]
[start 368.12] dominating on basically every platform [Duration: 5.72]
[start 371.36] interestingly the UK has by far in way [Duration: 5.279]
[start 373.84] the most Pro Palestine social media with [Duration: 5.52]
[start 376.639] six times more Pro Palestine posts than [Duration: 5.721]
[start 379.36] pro-israel ones more recent data from [Duration: 5]
[start 382.36] axio suggests the disparity is [Duration: 4.839]
[start 384.36] particularly acute on Tik Tok which has [Duration: 5.2]
[start 387.199] one of the youngest user bases of all [Duration: 5]
[start 389.56] social media platforms according to axus [Duration: 4.759]
[start 392.199] there's been about 10 times more Pro [Duration: 4.641]
[start 394.319] Palestine posts than pro-israel ones on [Duration: 5.32]
[start 396.84] Tik Tok which have received nearly five [Duration: 4.04]
[start 399.639] times as many [Duration: 3.761]
[start 400.88] views the third reason is ethnic [Duration: 4.84]
[start 403.4] diversity in essence younger people have [Duration: 4.6]
[start 405.72] a larger non-white population and [Duration: 4.56]
[start 408] non-whites are more likely to be Pro [Duration: 4.84]
[start 410.28] Palestine in the US for instance gen Zed [Duration: 6.28]
[start 412.84] is 49% white compared to 72% White for [Duration: 5.919]
[start 416.56] Boomers according to Gallup polling [Duration: 4.44]
[start 418.759] nonwhite Americans are far less pro- [Duration: 4.56]
[start 421] Israel with a sympathy towards Israel of [Duration: 6.52]
[start 423.319] 26% compared to 58% for white Americans [Duration: 5.641]
[start 427.52] similarly white Americans have a [Duration: 3.84]
[start 428.96] favorable opinion of Israel of [Duration: 5.04]
[start 431.36] 71% while non-white Americans come in [Duration: 4.959]
[start 434] significantly lower at [Duration: 5.72]
[start 436.319] 62% so there are three tentative reasons [Duration: 5.361]
[start 439.72] that might partially explain why young [Duration: 4.56]
[start 441.68] people are so Pro Palestine again we [Duration: 4.28]
[start 444.28] want to stress that this isn't intended [Duration: 3.599]
[start 445.96] as a complete explanation and we [Duration: 3.6]
[start 447.879] recognize that opinions on the issue you [Duration: 3.361]
[start 449.56] are complicated there are any other [Duration: 3.52]
[start 451.24] reasons you can think of or if you think [Duration: 3.92]
[start 453.08] we've missed anything do let us know in [Duration: 2.959]
