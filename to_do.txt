sql injection in go

what if we get 429 and the I need to send it to the


 in the return_string_based_on_user_details_for_encryption_text func I should escape if the user enters a string with -|- my code cannot parse it or will give me
 an error. so I should parse it

 for paid user use openai charge them 3 dollar where 1 dollar is for you and 2 for their api pricing and give them some tokens
 a func to make the user a paid user

 a len check if the string is more than 2000 char then do not make the response to the groq for the unpaid user

add openAi integration for the paid users and also a way to add some sort way for the user to use ti 2 a day(paid)-- or run some sort of credit(maybe implement a interface for it)

the code panics if my groq key is wrong -- use QXxeyOVpnCU in the ytvideo to reproduce

verify the auth token form the forntend and then in the function when you send the video subtitle check the db for the user preety sure I have a way around this (they key would not be signed)

in the future add the key in the db to make sure that they are removed fr fr and people can't use it


-- make the AccountID field in the DB be string 

-- in the forntend make for the razorpay id make a counter that when exceeds 1 for any of them reftech the order id as user  might need to do it 

-- in the website the data flow (first start can be simplified such) that that I do not need to fetch the order id again and again(with the help of shared state), this is inefficient / hacked together and poorly thought through
