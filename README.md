# Project abandoned: YouTube Sponsorship Skipper

After some time trying to get this project off the
ground, I've decided to abandon it and move on to other ideas.

## What this project was

This was a Chrome extension that would:

Grab YouTube video transcripts
Use an LLM (Gemini/Groq) to detect sponsorship segments
Automatically skip those sponsor sections while you watch

## Why I'm dropping it

Two main roadblocks I kept hitting:

My IP keeps getting banned when deployed (not cool)
YouTube API restrictions make it impossible to get captions from videos I don't own
I've spent way too many late nights trying to find workarounds, but at
this point I'm calling it. Time to focus energy elsewhere.

Still want to try it?
The code still works fine if you run it locally. If
you want to mess around with it:

Clone the repo
Create a .env file with your keys(sample  env is provided):
Both Gemini and Groq offer free API access, so you can grab keys without paying

### What's next(in this project)?

 I was planning to launch the chrome extension and launch it to the product hunt


 ### Workaround:--
 * We can get the XML timed from the chrome extension and mine it form the backend
